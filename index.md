### Data Science X Logistic Regression

Jun 2023 - Present

The term DataScience in the title will be clearly considered by some to be abusive. That is true. The subject is vast.
In [DSLR](https://github.com/plagache/DSLR), I have to perform a multi-classifier using a logistic regression one-vs-all.

- I had to learn how to read a data set, to visualize it in different ways, to select and clean unnecessary information from the dataset.
- I have to train a logistic regression that will solve classification problem.

### Inception of Things

Feb 2023 - Present

This [project](https://github.com/plagache/inception_of_things) is a System Administration related exercise. It consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.
The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine.

- The first part introduces us to K3s and Vagrant.
- The Second part deepens our knowledge on Ingress.
- The last part makes us discover K3d and Argo CD.

### Ping

Jan 2023 - Present

This [project](https://github.com/plagache/ping) is about recoding the ping command with the C language
Ping is the name of a command that allows to test the accessibility of another machine through the IP network. The command measures also the time taken to receive a response, called round-trip time.

- I had to learn about various internet protocole such has ipv4 and icmp.
- I had to implement the creation, sending of socket.
- I had to implement parsing for different icmp echo responses.
- I had to implement time management to determine the round-trip time.

### Linear Regression

Apr - May 2023

This [project](https://github.com/plagache/linear_regression) was an introduction to the basic concept behind machine learning.

I had to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
